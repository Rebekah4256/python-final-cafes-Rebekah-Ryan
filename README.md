Analyzing cafe sales for my Python final project

This is the orginal data set I was thinking of working with:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wardabilal/exploring-coffee-sales-with-eda-and-visualization

I looked in the original data set a little more and have found there was no way to tell the difference between the rows, so I have swapped my data set to:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabbas757/coffee-sales
As this data set has more information, it tells the difference between transactions.
